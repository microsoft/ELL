# Embedded Learning Library
The Embedded Learning Library (ELL) allows you to design and deploy intelligent machine-learned models onto resource constrained platforms and small single-board computers, like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and micro:bit. The deployed models run locally, without requiring a network connection and without relying on servers in the cloud. ELL is an early preview of the embedded AI and machine learning technologies developed at Microsoft Research. 

Go to our [website](https://microsoft.github.io/ELL) for tutorials, instructions, and a gallery of pretrained ELL models for use in your projects. 

ELL is a work in progress, and we expect it to change rapidly, including breaking API changes. Despite this code churn, we welcome you to try it and give us feedback.
