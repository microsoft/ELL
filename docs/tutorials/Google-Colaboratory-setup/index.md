# Google Colaboratory Setup

*by Yash Gaurkar*

Most Embedded Learning Library (ELL) tutorials follow a common workflow. You typically start by designing an ELL model on a laptop or desktop computer. It is easy to setup ELL on the system but it takes some time to build the binaries for ELL. And if you prefer to use Google Colab to train your model then you will prefer to generate the trained model on the same platform for different devices.

Find the colab notebook here:

* [ELL on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github//microsoft/ELL/blob/master/docs/tutorials/Google-Colaboratory-setup/Using_ELL_in_Colab.ipynb): This Notebook contains pre-build Latest Version of ELL and commands to build your preferred version of ELL. If you want to use pre-build Latest Version of ELL then you can get started within 5 mins of which most of the time it take to install Base Models for ELL.
